# my-books
Code Challenge to create app with two components, with design specs based on provided PSDs. Javascript libraries of any kind are discouraged (I use only handlebars for cleaner templating). Component one is a list of books with with a button that launches a model form to add a new book. Validations are specific, with user feedback. Component two is a top 10 list. Data is accessed and stored as a json object.
